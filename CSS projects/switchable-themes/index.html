        <h1>The Theme Switcher</h1>
        <h3>A short and sweet story about a cat who is responsible for switching our themes from day to night and back</h3>
        <p>
          Penelope wasn't your average feline. Sure, she enjoyed napping in sunbeams and chasing dust motes, but Penelope also held a secret. She was
          the Keeper of the Light.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perched atop the computer monitor, her emerald gaze fixated on the little crescent moon icon. The house was bathed in the crisp light of day
          mode, which humans, bless their oblivious hearts, thought was a simple setting. Penelope knew better.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the afternoon sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows, Penelope stretched languidly. It was time. With a powerful flick of her
          tail, a silent command rippled through the air. The humans, completely unaware, would rub their eyes, attributing the sudden dimness to the
          dying light. The screens would glow a calming blue, the room a soothing twilight. Night mode had arrived.
        </p>
        <p>
          Penelope, a creature of the night, thrived in the cool, blue light. Her midnight fur shimmered, and her hunting instincts sharpened. She'd
          stalk the feathery dust bunnies with renewed vigor, their nighttime glow betraying their hiding spots.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the first sliver of dawn peeked through the curtains, Penelope would execute another tail-flick. The screens would snap back to their
          stark white, the room greeting the rising sun. The humans, bleary-eyed, would curse the brightness, never suspecting their feline overlord's
          role.
        </p>
        <p>
          One morning, a new human arrived, a wide-eyed toddler. He pointed at the screen, giggling, "Moon gone! Sun come back!" Penelope, startled,
          looked up from her morning nap. For the first time, someone might witness her power.
        </p>
        <p>
          The toddler, oblivious to her apprehension, crawled closer, chubby fingers outstretched. Tentatively, he touched the screen, the little moon
          icon reappearing. The room plunged into night mode. The toddler clapped, delighted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Penelope, with a rumble in her chest that felt suspiciously like a purr, realized something new. Maybe, just maybe, sharing her secret
          wouldn't be so bad after all. Perhaps, together, they could usher in the day and night, a tiny human and his feline ruler. A purr escaped
          her, much to the toddler's amusement. After all, who wouldn't want an apprentice to help manage the light?
