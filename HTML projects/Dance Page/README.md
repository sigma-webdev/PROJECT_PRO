# Dance Page

## About this projectüßë‚Äçüíª
You are required to create a landing page for a hypothetical dance studio. The page should be visually appealing, using modern web design principles, and provide an excellent user experience. You can use any Google Font of your choice, such as Poppins or Montserrat. Ensure the webpage fits the screen size properly (100vh and 100vw) without any horizontal or vertical scrolling on a laptop view.
