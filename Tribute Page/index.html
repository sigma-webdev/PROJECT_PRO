        <ul>
          <li>
            Subhas Chandra Bose was born on <strong>January 23, 1897, in Cuttack,
              Odisha</strong>. He was the 9th child of his parents.
          </li>

          <li>
            Bose excelled academically and stood 2nd in the 1913 matriculation
            examination. He passed the Indian Civil Services (ICS) examination
            but resigned in 1921 to join the freedom movement.
          </li>

          <li>
            Bose was a strong advocate for India’s complete independence. He
            formed the Congress Volunteer Corps and became the General Secretary
            of the Indian National Congress.
          </li>

          <li>
            In <strong>1942, Bose formed the Azad Hind Fauj (Indian National Army)</strong> in
            collaboration with Japan. His famous slogan was: <strong>“Tum Mujhe Khoon
              Do, Main Tumhe Azadi Dunga”</strong> (Give me blood, and I will give you
            freedom).
          </li>

          <li>
            Bose was greatly influenced by the teachings of Swami Vivekananda
            and Ramkrishna Paramhansa.
          </li>

          <li>
            The British put Bose under house arrest, but he managed to escape to
            Germany and then to Japan.
          </li>

          <li>
            In Japan, Bose began the formation of the Indian National Army (INA)
            to fight alongside the Axis powers against the British.
          </li>

          <li>
            Subhas Chandra Bose remains a symbol of courage, patriotism, and
            resilience in India’s struggle for independence. His contributions
            continue to inspire generations.
          </li>

          <li>
            Bose’s approach differed from Mahatma Gandhi’s non-violence. He
            believed in direct action against the British.
          </li>

          <li>
            Bose’s death remains a mystery. The plane crash in which he was
            traveling in Taiwan in 1945 is still debated.
